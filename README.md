# How to Use Microsoft Feature Management
Feature management is a modern software-development practice that decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability on demand. It uses a technique called feature flags (also known as feature toggles, feature switches, and so on) to dynamically administer a feature's lifecycle.
